This is my trading bot that will eventually make me a millionaire, aptly named "Gatsby".

Do not read into why it might be called Gatsby. There is no foreshadowing or deeper meaning.

Also, if you havent, do not read "The Great Gatsby" (or the sparknotes) as it is completely unrelated and has nothing to do with this bot.

Gatsby is a personal project that I'm working on because it combines my interests in finance and coding. 

===DISCLAIMER===

This bot will most likely lose money so don't use it, and if you do don't blame me because I told you so.
I am only testing this with a paper account (maybe real money later if the backtesting looks good, which it does not right now).

Libraries used include pandas, pandas-ta, tradingview-ta, lumibot, alpaca, so if you use this you're gonna have to pip install all that
plus maybe some others i'm forgetting.

I will not provide instructions on how to use this because I don't want to, you can figure it out yourself
